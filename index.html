    Plastic's Journey is born at the oil refinery.

    The plastic is then melted down and formed into molds

    Once the plastic product is ready it is transported and shipped to retailers.

  <div>From the extracting raw materials to transporting the finished plastic product, approximately 82.8 grams of CO2 emissions are produced.</div>

    After plastic has been discarded, plastic could end up in numerous places. 
</div>
<img src="images/two-arrow.png" alt="two arrows pointing opposite directions" Width="128" height="128">

  <div>
    The first stop is the landfill, where leachate from the plastics can poison local waterways over time.
</div>

  The plastic could also end up in a stream, river, or ocean

  If the plastic ends up in a waterway it can later become a part of one of the Great Pacific Garbage Patches. (There are 5 in the world at the moment.)

  Eventually, the plastic breaks down into microplastic in the water.

  These microplastics can then be consumed by fish, which are then consumed by us.

  <h1 class="save">How You Can Consume Responsibly (And Save Money and the Planet Doing It)</h1>
	<div class="container">
		<p>Buying in bulk at package-free shops saves you money in the long run compared to buying single-packaged products. Let's use dried mango as an example.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Product</th>
				<th>Quantity</th>
				<th>Price</th>
				<th>Cost per Serving</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Trader Joe's Dried Mango</td>
				<td>6 oz (4 servings)</td>
				<td>$4.99</td>
				<td>$1.25</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Bulk Dried Mango</td>
				<td>2 lbs</td>
				<td>$27</td>
				<td>$1.18</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>As you can see, there is not much of a difference in price between the two options. However, the bulk dried mango is a fair trade product, unlike the Trader Joe's dried mango. Plus, what you save on is quality, time, and your impact on the planet.</p>
		<p>It would take 5.35 Trader Joe's bags of dried mangoes to equal 2 pounds. That's 5.35 plastic bags with 5.35 different paths to the ocean. By buying in bulk, you are reducing your plastic waste and contributing to a cleaner planet.</p>
