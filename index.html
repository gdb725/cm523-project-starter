<h1>It takes 1,000 years for x amount of plastic to decompose.</h1>
<h2>We did the math. You're only a SOME FRACTION OF A NUMBER part of plasticâ€™s life.</h2>
<p>Start from Oil refineries where oil and gas were combined to make MONOMERS (Polyethylene Terephthalate) CALCULATE THE CO2 PUT OUT BY MAKING ONE PIECE OF PLASTIC</p>
<p>Polymer chains are used to make plastic.</p>
<p>The plastic is melted and formed in molds </p> 
<ul> 
  <li>shipped</li> 
  <li>bought</li> 
  <li>Consumed</li> 
  <li>discarded</li> 
</ul>
<p>The first stop is the landfill, where leachate poisons local waterways.</p> 
<p>The second stop is a stream, river, or ocean</p> 
<p>Here plastic becomes part of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch</p> 
<p>one of five plastic garbage patches that exist in the world's oceans today.</p> 
<p>Eventually, the plastic breaks down into microplastic</p> 
<p>which can make its way back into our food.</p>

  <h1>How You Can Consume Responsibly (And Save Money and the Planet Doing It)</h1>
	<div class="container">
		<p>Buying in bulk at package-free shops saves you money in the long run compared to buying single-packaged products. Let's use dried mango as an example.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Product</th>
				<th>Quantity</th>
				<th>Price</th>
				<th>Cost per Serving</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Trader Joe's Dried Mango</td>
				<td>6 oz (4 servings)</td>
				<td>$4.99</td>
				<td>$1.25</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Bulk Dried Mango</td>
				<td>2 lbs</td>
				<td>$27</td>
				<td>$1.18</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>As you can see, there is not much of a difference in price between the two options. However, the bulk dried mango is a fair trade product, unlike the Trader Joe's dried mango. Plus, what you save on is quality, time, and your impact on the planet.</p>
		<p>It would take 5.35 Trader Joe's bags of dried mangoes to equal 2 pounds. That's 5.35 plastic bags with 5.35 different paths to the ocean. By buying in bulk, you are reducing your plastic waste and contributing to a cleaner planet.</p>
